GridLayout for Compose is a library that provides missing non lazy grid layout composables for Compose Multiplatform.

![grid-examples](docs/images/grid-overview-examples.png)

Jetpack Compose doesn't offer non lazy grid layout, there are only lazy grid layout and alternatives (for example, flow layout).
But sometimes, we need to use grid layout for less complexity and more intuitive layout code.
This library can be simpler solution for small grid UI.

There are benefits of this library:

- **Similar API to LazyGrid**: The GridLayout's APIs are designed to provide similar development experience to LazyGrid.
- **Easy to implement various grid**: There are _"Fixed"_, _"Adaptive"_ and _"FixedSize"_ for grid layout management like LazyGrid.
  Like LazyGrid, it eliminates dealing with different screen sizes.
- **Simple to use as a part of LazyList**: The GridLayout is not lazy layout. It can be simply placed in lazy layouts.
  If only a portion of the full layout is grid, No need to use LazyGrid with span size for full layout.
- **Efficient for small datasets**: LazyGrid has complex logics for large datasets. But when datasets are small, it can be inefficient.
  The GridLayout is just a simple layout. It can be more efficient for smaller datasets.

## Installation

To download this library, add dependency to your gradle:

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation("com.cheonjaeung.compose.grid:grid:<version>")
}
```

**After the 2.0.0 version, the group id and package name is changed from**
**`io.woong.compose.grid` to `com.cheonjaeung.compose.grid`.**

## Usage

![usage-example](docs/images/usage-example.png)

```kotlin
VerticalGrid(
    columns = SimpleGridCells.Fixed(3),
    modifier = Modifier.fillMaxWidth(),
) {
    for ((index, color) in colors.withIndex()) {
        ColorBox(
            modifier = Modifier,
            color = color,
            text = (index + 1).toString(),
        )
    }
}
```

## Building

This project is kotlin multiplatform project.
It's recommended to setup kotlin multiplatform developement environment.

### Samples

This project contains sample app project in the `samples` directory.
You can run sample app both Andorid and iOS (iOS sample app can run only on the macOS).

### Testing

This project uses snapshot testing.
To run test, run following command:

```shell
./gradlew :grid:verifyPaparazziDebug
```

If you add test cases, run following command to create new snapshots:

```shell
./gradlew :grid:recordPaparazziDebug
```

If test is failed, you can check what is wrong from diff images.
The diff images are generated in `grid/build/paparazzi/failures/` with `delta-*` name.

### Binary Compatibility

This project runs public binary API compatibility validation on CI.
If you change public APIs, run following command before commit:

```shell
./gradlew apiDump
```

And you should commit api files with your code changes.
